    <div id="date">Programming Competition | 2013</div>

    <hr>

    <div class="message"><a href="http://www.battlecode.org/" target="_blank">Battlecode</a> is a programming competition held over <a href="http://web.mit.edu/iap/" target="_blank">IAP</a> (Independent Activities Period)-which is the entire month of January. A game in Battlecode pits two competitor programmed artificial intelligences against each other in a game of real time strategy.  The object of 2013's game was to kill the enemy's HQ before the enemy killed your HQ.  This begins with building units from your HQ which can then build more units which in this years battlecode helped with defense or supplying your army. Here are a few interesting aspects of 2013's game:</div>

        <div class="subtitle">Shared Radio Space</div>
        <hr>
        <div class="message">
          Robots in the game communicate via a "radio" system which is an 65000 length array that could be written and read by any robot.  The radio system this year was shared and so you had to be very careful when sending messages. Some teams even developed strategies in which they read the entire radio and rewrote anything they found in hopes of sabotaging the other team's communications. To combat this we used error correcting codes from 6.02 (signals and systems).

          There were a lot of units this year and so it was important that your soldiers didn't get in the way of each other. The way we accomplished this was by making our soldiers make a line in the direction perpendicular to the line to the enemy hq.  This meant that whenever our soldiers got into a fight they would get a huge concave on the enemy and this let us win a lot of fights even when we had less soldiers

        <div class="subtitle">Deciding What to Build</div>

        <div class="message">
          It was a pretty hard problem to decide what to build when because knowing when to defend and when to just take your time and make a bigger army was a hard choice.

        <div class="subtitle">Identifying Opponent's Strategy and Reacting Fast and With Conviction</div>
        <hr>
        <div class="message">
          We made the decision to have a soldier kamikaze into the opponents units in the beginning so that we could see what units our opponent was building and react quickly to that.  For instance there was one strategy that just made mines to protect their hq and researched the autowin technology.  In order to beat it you had to identify they were doing this and then attack quickly and research technology for making mines not hurt your soldiers.  This allowed us to do this.
