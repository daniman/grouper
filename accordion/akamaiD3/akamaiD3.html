    <div id="date">Akamai Internship | 2014</div>

    <hr>

    <div class="message">Over the summer in 2014 I interned at Akamai http://www.akamai.com/ working on data visualiztion.  I was particularly interested in this internship because I already had experience in data visualization from my Game Lab project and was hoping to get some experience in it in terms of web dev. My internship consisted of working in a team of 4 designing and programming visualizations for the 28 screens in Akamai's NOCC http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/nocc.html .  My dataset for this was Akamai's maintenance data on their servers in terms of software, maintenance fixes, ongoing problems, etc.

    One of my main endeavors was creating a geographical representation of all of this data.  I did this using Leaflet and D3</div>

        <div class="subtitle">Why Leaflet?</div>

        <div class="message">
          Leaflet was Open-source: this was quite useful because I had to go source diving more than once in order to solve a problem with the legacy browser on the NOCC
          Easy to use tilesets you want:
          Compatibility with Chloropleths: it's a damn tutorial http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth.html
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">Chloropleth Map</div>
        <hr>
        <div class="message">
          Made a new metric
          Used a chloropleth because heatmaps inevitably become population maps a la xkcd
          divided by total capacity because in order to normalize and make sure that when a country was losing a lot of capacity to a ticket, it was shown as a big problem
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">Markers for Tickets, Maintenances</div>

        <div class="message">
          interestingly had a lot of browser compatibility issues because I wanted to make it work well on laptops and on the huge screens in the NOCC
