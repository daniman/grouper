    <div class="message">Over the summer in 2014 I interned at Akamai http://www.akamai.com/ working on data visualiztion.  I was particularly interested in this internship because I already had experience in data visualization from my Game Lab project and was hoping to get some experience in it in terms of web dev. My internship consisted of working in a team of 4 designing and programming visualizations for the 28 screens in Akamai's NOCC http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/nocc.html .  My dataset for this was Akamai's maintenance data on their servers in terms of software, maintenance fixes, ongoing problems, etc.</div>
