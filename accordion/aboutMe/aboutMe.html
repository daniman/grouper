        <div class="message">Hiya! I'm Nick Mohr. I'm a Junior at MIT and I've interned at Akamai and will be interning at Addepar this summer.  In my time away from work I'm constantly thinking of new projects.  At any given time I have somewhere between 50 and 100 unimplemented ideas in my notes.  Sometimes I'm thinking about how a gif search engine should be organized or sometimes I think about the best way to organize my personal website.  I'm really passionate about data visualization.  I find that when I'm looking at a dataset I really enjoy thinking about exactly what someone looking at this data would want to see, and making this intended use as clear and beautiful as possible.  In that vein I am constantly amazed by Mike Bostock's work on D3 (Link to mike bostock's blocks)</div>

          I care a <i>lot</i> about music.  I've been playing cello for the past 10 years and my favorite composers are Bloch and Bach. I also listen to a lot of different types of music.  Indie rock/electronic, hip hop, korean pop and korean indie music would be a basic summary of my music tastes.  With this comes a lot of opinions about music sites. I love <a href="8tracks.com" target="_blank">8tracks</a> and <a href="http://songza.com/" target="_blank">songza</a> for finding new music.  I also think <a href="https://bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">bandcamp</a> is really innovative, allowing artists to independantly release their music and get paid for it.  I like spotify but it's not particularly good for <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9226497" target="_blank">paying</a>  the artists that I actually listen to.

          I'm a big fan of Video Games-especially competitive E-Sports. I love playing SSBM (Marth), SC2 (Protoss), and Hearthstone.
