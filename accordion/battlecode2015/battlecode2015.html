      <a href="http://www.battlecode.org/" target="_blank">Battlecode</a> is a programming competition held over <a href="http://web.mit.edu/iap/" target="_blank">IAP</a> (Independent Activities Period)-which is the entire month of January. A game in Battlecode pits two competitor programmed artificial intelligences against each other in a game of real time strategy.  In 2015, The object of the game was to destroy the enemy headquarters. Each team has up to six towers on the map, and destroying these towers weakens the headquarters. 2015 was a year of incredibly imbalanced units. We had 6 different fighting units and it was horribly unfair in the sprint tournament where only one unit was viable. Then in the final tournament only one unit was any good again, though it depended on the map whether you could just open into it.</div>

          Supply necessitated that you had a good system for distributing it. We decided to make a double queue system out of the radio system (a global static int array) where army had priority over miners because army was what kept you from dying in the early game.

          Miners mined at pretty much the same rate as long as the mineral patch they were on was above a certain threshold. For this reason we had miners search the closest mineral patches first because traveling time ended up being a huge factor.

        <div class="subtitle">Build order</div>

        <div class="message">
          Because this game was very similar to starcraft we created a build order class so that we could easily specify an exact build order. This was important because the top teams worked out the exact best builds with precision down to the turn.
