    	First I worked over the summer in a UROP position for the gameLab. We had some original ideas and we made our own mod for starcraft 2 observing.

	One major problem we had with this interface was that we overused our screen real estate, and didn't just leave room for the viewers to watch the game. We also had a big problem with getting tournaments to adopt our mod because there was another mod that was already in use and the tournaments did not want to change their current layouts.
	</p>
	<p>

	After the summer we decided we wanted to take a new direction to take our work and merge it in with the viewer mod that was in use by the tournaments. We started making small additions to the mod and they got merged in to master incrementally. Here's a few links to some of the additions to the regualar interface we made:

	<a class="link" href="http://gamelab.mit.edu/sc2-notifications-gif-extravaganza/" target="_blank">Gif extravaganza</a>
	<p>
A few months after we merged in all of our changes we were contacted by Blizzard about the mod.  They had decided that our mod benefitted the viewer experience so much that they wanted to have our work signed over to them so that they could QA it in house and use it in all official Blizzard tournaments.
