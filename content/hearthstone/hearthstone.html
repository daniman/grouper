    <div class="message">I'm a 'Legendary' player at Hearthstone.  This means I was roughly in the top 2000 players for a given month (my month was December 2014). I got to legend using <a href="http://www.liquidhearth.com/forum/constructed-strategy/473834-xixo-zoo-how-to-get-three-1-legends" target="_blank">Xixo zoo</a>. Hearthstone is pretty fun and it is surprisingly deep when you try to get to the higher ranks.  My advice to any Hearthstone player that is trying to get better would be to force yourself to take the maximum amount of time on late game moves.  Think long and hard about what their actions reveal about what they have in their hand and deck and how that relates to what you should play.
