    <div class="message">Starcraft 2 is my favorite competitive game. The main reason why I first got into it was that I saw how intensely competitive it was-especially in Korea.  I also really enjoyed the league system because it meant climbing a ladder and being able to look down on where you were before and how much you have improved.  My proudest achievement was beating a <a href="http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/INcontroL" target="_blank">semi-pro Starcraft player</a> while he was streaming (and my second proudest moment was listening to him badmouth my strategy after we played).  I'm basically always in Master league and I've occasionally tried to make the break into Grandmaster, the top 200 players in a continent-without any success as of yet.
