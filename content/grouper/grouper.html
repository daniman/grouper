      Grouper is more or less what you just looked at to get to this modal! We made Grouper to be an innovative way for class administrators to create diverse groups quickly.  I worked on the bubbles that I turned into my website.  I worked with D3.js, JavaScript, along with a bit of HTML and CSS3. I created Grouper with Danielle Man and Morgan Voss.

          We decided from early onset that we wanted to let the user physically move around the people in the groups.  We had a few ideas of how to do this but we decided that making bubbles was clearly the best. In the end we decided to have a couple means of interaction by the user.  The user can move bubbles around from group to group by just clicking on a bubble and dragging it to another group. We thought this would be slow for expert users though so we added being able to click on one bubble to select it and click on another bubble to make them switch.

          Danielle made a really great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pEuiGU-wx0" target="_blank">video</a> for our presentation. We won the <strong>Best Direct Manipulation Interaction</strong> award as well as the <strong>Audience Choice</strong> award among about 50 teams.  We are also planning on having UPOP (the Undergraduate Practice Opportunities Program) use Grouper to build their teams since they particularly need to create diverse groups.
