    <div class="message"><a href="https://partyset.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">P(arty)Set</a> is an app that my friends and I made in order to make it easier to find PSet (Problem Set) Parties on MIT campus, especially when you don't know anyone in the class.  If you don't know anyone in your class it becomes very hard to know who to talk to and who to work with.  We solved this by creating a live updating mapping of all PSet Parties which are filtered based on the classes that you are taking.  We made Partyset using Node.js, mongodb, mongoose, socket.io (for pulling updates to our map in real time), leaflet, and passport.js.  We built partyset for Software Studio (6.170).</div>
