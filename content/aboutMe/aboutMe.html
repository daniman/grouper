        <div class="message">Hiya! I'm Nick Mohr. I'm a Senior at MIT and I've interned at Addepar (2015) and Akamai (2014).  In my time away from work I'm constantly thinking of new projects.  At any given time I have somewhere between 50 and 100 unimplemented ideas in my notes.  Sometimes I'm thinking about how a gif search engine should be organized or sometimes I think about the best way to organize my personal website.  I'm really passionate about data visualization.  I find that when I'm looking at a dataset I really enjoy thinking about exactly what someone looking at this data would want to see, and making this intended use as clear and beautiful as possible.  In that vein I am constantly amazed by <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock" target="_blank">Mike Bostock's work on D3</a></div>

          I care a <i>lot</i> about music.  I've been playing cello for the past 10 years and my favorite composers are Bloch and Bach. I also listen to a lot of different types of music.  Indie rock/electronic, hip hop, korean pop and korean indie music would be a basic summary of my music tastes.  With this comes a lot of opinions about music sites. I love <a href="8tracks.com" target="_blank">8tracks</a> and <a href="http://songza.com/" target="_blank">songza</a> for finding new music.  I also think <a href="https://bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">bandcamp</a> is really innovative, allowing artists to independantly release their music and get paid for it.  I like spotify but it's not particularly good for <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9226497" target="_blank">paying</a>  the artists that I actually listen to.

          I'm a big fan of Video Games-especially competitive E-Sports. I love playing SSBM (Marth), SC2 (Protoss), and Hearthstone.
